This model is created using Sketchup and it's 3d marketplace. This model is the exact replica of the actual school idea. There are some of the sustainable features of the model:

### Features:
1. Use of Solar pannels.
2. Glasses are galzed.
3. Solar Chimmy.
4. Thermal insulation
5. Carbon Capture.
6. Rainwater harvesting.
7. Water Containers

## Solar Pannels

We have placed solar pannels right above the classrooms which are located at the south-east which are exposed to the sunlight for the longest, the solar pannels are rotating and initilly they are located at the south east. Solar Pannels are also palced at the organic farms which also run on hydropower.

## Glass Glazing

Glass Glazing is a concept where we place different panes with gaps of inert gases which prevent the building from insulating. Here, we are going on with the two panes which should be enough and it is more economically feasable rather than three-layered window galzing.

## Solar Chimmy

Solar Chimmy will be used in the winters which will prevent the heat from going out since they are sealed during winter season. It is a way of natural ventalation by using the air heated by solar pannels.

## Thermal Insulation

It reduces heat transfer between the indoor classrooms by introducing a barreir between them.

## Carbon Capture

We have also placed carbon capture at the top of the classrooms which is a process of capturing carbon and it is later on transfered to the ground.

## Rainwater harvesting

Rainwater harvesting is done at the organic farms and we have placed turbines to convert the poteintial energy of water to power the agricultural appliances.

## Water Containers

Water Containers store the rainwater and purify it which is latter processed and delivered to the agricultural sector through pipes and turbines.
